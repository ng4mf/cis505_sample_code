# The Makefile is based on the explanation of Makefiles that is found here:
# http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/make/

# We are using g++, so we specify the compiler 
CXX = g++

# We are using the C++ 11 standard, that is Flag 1
# We want debugging outputs, so Flag #2 is -Wall
# We want to have the generated executable be debuggable, hence -g
# If we want to include another directory, say because our .h files are separated out 
# 	from our source files (a common project organization technique), we can tell the
# 	compiler that the files called in the #include statements might also be in the 
# 	directory specified by -I
# -fsanitize=address is to enable the address sanitizer, which will help you catch 
#  	memory bugs early, so long as you test your code frequently
# The name CPPFLAGS is somewhat of a standard, but you can name it whatever
# 	you want.
CPPFLAGS = -std=c++11 -Wall -g -I./emptydir -fsanitize=address

# We don't actually need the pthread shared library to be linked, this is 
# just as an example of how you could use it
# As before, LDFLAGS is somewhat of a standard, but you can name it something else
# 	too.
# As with the -I flag for CPPFLAGS, libraries can be added by path via -L, 
# 	please look it up for more details
# -pthread: POSIX thread library
# -lasan: address sanitizer library
LDFLAGS = -pthread -lasan

# Collect ALL source files ending in .cc into a single Make variable
SRC = $(wildcard *.cc)

# We want to create a variable saying that we will generate OBJECT files
# for all the files contained in the variable called SRC, but converting
# the file endings from .cc to .o
OBJ = $(SRC:.cc=.o)

# We want smart compilation based on whether something needs to be recompiled or
# not. Thus, we generate dependency files containing which other files an object file
# depends on, and using this Make can determine exactly which files need to be 
# recompiled before the project is relinked. This isn't actually used for this example.
# See the link at the top for details on how to use this.
DEP = $(OBJ:.o:.d) 

# peanut_butter_cup_cookie is the TARGET, i.e. the output executable
# It's dependencies are listed following the colon, note that the variable is 
# 	specified using an "escape" $ AND parentheses. Without parentheses, Make 
# 	will only recognize the FIRST LETTER after the $ as the variable name
peanut_butter_cup_cookie: $(OBJ) 
	$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)

# Explanations for Line 30-31:
#   - There is NO SPACE before the target name on Line 30
# 	- There is EXACTLY ONE tab character (not 4 or 8 spaces, but 1 tab character)
# 			on the line following the rule peanut_butter_cup_cookie
# 	- $@ is a special variable in make that refers to the name of the rule, in this 
# 			case, $@ = peanut_butter_cup_cookie. You can specify something else if you
# 			want the generated output file to be named something else
# 	- $^ is another special variable. It refers to all things after the colon on 
# 			Line 30. That is, it refers to the dependencies of the rule
# 	- Though unused, $< is another special variable meaning the FIRST dependency after
# 			the colon. 
# 	- Unrelated to make directly, but something that catches some off guard is the location of 
# 			$(LDFLAGS), i.e. libraries. Location can matter a lot!

# A PHONY rule is not a target to compile, but rather an argument passed to Make
# that tells it to do specific things. The most common is cleaning the project, which
# means removal of all the object files.
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(OBJ) peanut_butter_cup_cookie

# Here's another to remove dependency files
.PHONY: cleandep
cleandep:
	rm -f $(wildcard *.d)
